      data-text="In this age of &quot;high tech&quot;, with its ever expanding plethora of machines, computers, devices, gadgets, tools and the like, we all end up amassing stuff which no longer works.

What, then, do we do with it.   The easy but expensive option is to bring it to Derryconnell Recycling Centre.   We've lost the culture of repairing things, and manufacturers don't want us to fix things, they want us to buy the latest new model...
But in many cases there's a fix, often a simple one, and our broken devices can be resurrected.

In response to this throwaway culture, a couple of years ago the Ballydehob Repair Café was born.   It's now one of over eighty such Repair Cafés in Ireland which share a similar ethos.
We're a group of people who want to challenge the culture of built-in obsolescence, by helping you bring your broken things back to life!

We're in the old Bank House from 3pm to 5:30pm on the last Friday of each month.   Bring your broken things, bring your skills to share, bring a smile!   And have a cuppa and a biscuit while we figure it out!"

        <h3>Planned Obsolescence is a Scam</h3>
        <p>Products are engineered to fail at a convenient time — just outside warranty, just before the next model drops. We think that's rubbish. Literally and figuratively.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="manifesto-block">
        <div class="manifesto-num">02</div>
        <h3>The Landfill Doesn't Need More Toasters</h3>
        <p>The UK discards millions of tonnes of electrical goods annually. Most failed due to a single component costing pennies. That's not acceptable — and it doesn't have to be that way.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="manifesto-block">
        <div class="manifesto-num">03</div>
        <h3>Skills Shouldn't Be Secrets</h3>
        <p>We don't just fix your stuff — we show you how. Repair knowledge should be passed on, not locked behind service contracts and proprietary screws.</p>
      </div>

        <h3>Ingenuity &gt; Consumption</h3>
        <p>There is something quietly radical about choosing to fix rather than replace. It's creative, sustainable, and — once you get into it — genuinely satisfying.</p>
